          <p class="text">Hello, I am an aspiring software developer who is currently enrolled in a 
            software development bootcamp. I believe that life is a journey, and my journey, like 
            those of countless others, has been full of all kinds of interesting experiences. Because
            everyone possesses such an eclectic collection of personal experiences, I believe that we 
            are all capable of contributing something positive to the growth and well-being of others.
            No matter how insignificant you may feel, there is someone who needs what you have to 
            offer. No matter how hopeless you may feel, you can always find the strength to take one more
            step. And no matter how broken you may think you are, there will be someone who has been 
            praying for someone exactly like you to come into their life. Keep moving forward!

          <p>This is a Hawaiian BBQ plate. This is definitely one of the most delicious
            things I have ever eaten. It comes with some kind of meat, usually chicken
            katsu, BBQ chicken, beef, and if you're feeling fancy, fried
            shrimp or fish. It comes with a side of mac and veggies. I highly
            recommend you sub the rice for more mac. If they make you pay extra, they 
            are probably terrible people. But get it anyways. And also doggy.

          <p>This is a burger. It has seasoned ground beef patties in between two
            buns with cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and special sauce.
            You usually order them with fries and a soda. I recommend you get
            diet soda because they taste the same minus like, 47g of sugar.
            Burgers are one of the most delicious things on the planet and 
            life would be bleak and meaningless without them. And also doggy.

          <p>This is a pizza. It is dough topped with marinara
            sauce, cheese, and a variety of other toppings ranging from meats to
            vegetables. Even pineapple, which people think is the worst thing ever
            but I like it. This particular pizza is topped with 
            pepperoni, sausage, and ham. Pizzas are truly one of the most delicious
            foods on the planet, and life would be a mundane, joyless facade without
            them. And also doggy.

        <div class="message" id="msg4">
          <p>This is a California Burrito. It comes [I think] from California. And 
            is a burrito. It is a flour tortilla filled with carne asada, cheese,
            sour cream, and fries. This might be the most delicious thing I have
            ever eaten in my life. These changed my life, and I would not
            be who I am without them. Without these, life would be nothing more than a soulless,
            nihilistic march to our inevitable graves. And also doggy.
